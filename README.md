# PokeMount
A simple Next.js 13 website styled with TailwindCSS and utilizing PokeAPI so that I could familiarize myself with NextJS and Tailwind (two birds with one stone, huh).

## Deployment

## Credits
- The website was built by following [this wonderful JSM Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUNSHPyVryU&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery) with its [Github Repo](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_next13_car_showcase/tree/client-version).
  - Styling is also primarily from JSM, but I also implemented my own preferences and made bug/styling fixes where possible and where it made sense.
- Images are all official sprites from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) with the exception being the Hero image which is from [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/dsx8/art/Pokemon-Scarlet-Violet-Koraidon-Render-946663980)
- Determining which Pokèmon were which kind of mounts was based on the [PixelmonMod Wiki](https://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/Mounting)
